<h1> Lotus </h1>

The lotus plant is a perennial, aquatic plant that thrives in nutrient-rich, murky conditions. Found across India, east Africa, southeast Asia, and Australia, this plant enjoys an active and interesting daily life cycle. Lotuses root themselves in the mud, their lengthy stems reaching upward to find the top of the water. There, the lush blossoms grow, and as the lotus blooms, the blossoms unfold one by one.

Petal by petal, each one emerges pristine from the mucky water thanks to a protective outer coating that repels dirt and water. These day-blooming plants submerge and close up at night, and reawaken above the water every morning. The petals last for just a handful of days before shedding.

The lotus appears in sacred texts and spiritual imagery from ancient Egypt to some early Buddhist texts. With that, it comes as no surprise that the lotus flower frequently symbolizes the Divine. Hinduism in particular finds rich meaning in the lotus flower. The lotus is referenced in Vedic texts dating back to 1400 BC! Several Hindu deities are frequently depicted with lotus flowers (or are otherwise associated with the lotus flower in some way). As the national flower of India, the lotus has long served as a symbol within the countryâ€™s arts, culture, philosophy, and religions.
